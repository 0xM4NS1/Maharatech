# Basic Static Analysis


# Hash
Step 1 : online Antivirus Scanning
search by hash, but that is not enough. That means if the creator changes one character, the fingerprint will change.
EX website : VirusTotal

Hashing : It's a process to create a cryptographic hash. 
eX : sha256 and md5 
md5 = 128 bit
sh1 = 160 bit 
sha2 = 256 bit

Hash Tools :
  Windows  :
    1 - HashTools                   2 - PEStudio              3 - QuickHash 
  Linux :
    1 - MD5SUM                      2 - SHA256 


# Strings :
what the information can i extract from string 
1 -file name
2 - URL 
3 - IP
4 - Registry Key
Asci = uses 7 bits to represnt character
       Requires less space

Unicode : Universal character 
Uses 8 bit , 16 bit ,32 bit
    UTF-8 , UTF-16 , UTF-32
      
Tools : 
1 - Strings 
2 - Bintext 
3 - PEStedio
4 - Floss

# PE_File
Portable Executable : The PE File Format is a data Structure That Contains the information necessary for windows OS loader to manage the executable code .

PE File contain : 
DOS MZ Header : 
this is not important 64 bytez  MZ the first tow bytes
DOS stub : 


PE header : 
the start signture PE (50 45 00  00) after these 4 byte we have now the file header : that contain 1 - number of section 2 - TimeDate Stamp 3 - Characteristics
OptionlHeader : Addrees of entry point 
2 - Image Base 
3- SizeOfImage



Section : the real data like code the most important info here ex what the function etc
