# Basic Static Analysis


# Hash
Step 1 : online Antivirus Scanning
search by hash, but that is not enough. That means if the creator changes one character, the fingerprint will change.
EX website : VirusTotal

Hashing : It's a process to create a cryptographic hash. 
eX : sha256 and md5 
md5 = 128 bit
sh1 = 160 bit 
sha2 = 256 bit

Hash Tools :
  Windows  :
    1 - HashTools                   2 - PEStudio              3 - QuickHash 
  Linux :
    1 - MD5SUM                      2 - SHA256 


# Strings :
what the information can i extract from string 
1 -file name
2 - URL 
3 - IP
4 - Registry Key
Asci = uses 7 bits to represnt character
       Requires less space

Unicode : Universal character 
Uses 8 bit , 16 bit ,32 bit
    UTF-8 , UTF-16 , UTF-32
