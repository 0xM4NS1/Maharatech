# ch1_What_Is _Malware
Malware : Is a program that is inserted into a system , usually covertly , with the intent of compromisisng the confidentiality , Integrity , Availability. 

How Malware violates the CIA ?
A- Confidentiality : When an attacker infiltrates a victim using malware, he can access the victim's privacy, such as looking into private files .
B- Integrity : The malware can edit and delete the files and users on system   
C- Availability : Malware can block me from accessing my data .


Malware Capabilities : 
1-Propagation : spread copies of themselves on the same machine or to another device using usb or network
2-Unauthorized Access  : the malware can access to my data and make an action into my device 
3-Destruction :delete files or destroy it
4-Information Theft : malware  can steal data 
5-Exploit :To control the system or establish its presence in the system

# CH01_VID02_Types of malware
Malware Types : 
1 - Virus: Malicious software inserted into a program or data file 
2 - Trojan : Malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program
3 - Worm : Self replicatin program uses network to travel from one computer to another
4 - Backdoor have tow type : 
  A - Rat(Remote access trojan / remote administrative)
  
  B - BotNet : Networ of hijacjed internet-connected computer 
      they are controlled remotely by (command and controller = Botnet Controller = Botmaster) ex DDOS attack
5- Logic Time bombs : piece of code inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specifirf conditions are met .
6 - Crypto virology that threatens to publish the victims data or block access to it unless a ransom is paid .
7 - Spyware : spying in victim machine , Data sent infected device to attacker
8 - Adware(Advestise) : Data sent from attacker to infected device
9 - user recieves a spam message with a link
10 - File less : using a spam email to download a malware

# CH01_VID03_Advanced malware (APT, rootkits and bootkits)

11 - Advanced persistent Threat(APT) : state sponsored group :remains undetected for an extended period
12 - Rootkit : Designed to hide the existence of certain processes from normal methodes of detection 
     Runs in kernal mode and have more than one tool example : Stuxnet , Flame
13 - Bootkits = Boot Capability + Rootkits
     Boot : The operation when turn on the windows.  
     are rootkits in which the first point of control is during the boot process ,This allows the malicious program to be executed before the operating system boots .
     Malicious boot record cannot just be deleted or removed without damaging the computer .
  
# CH01_VID04_PUPs

* PUPs(Potentially-Unwanted Programs) : They are programs which dont do anything good for you,thus they are unwanted
     They are usually bundled with other useful software EX Toolbars for the browser ,Add-ons /Extensions for browser / Desktop programs that show fake promotions or show the weather /
     Android apps That spam you with notifications or ads /
why cant we call the PUPs malware:
cuz we have the EULA : The end user license agreement informs the user that this additional is begin installed , and the user accepts it.

# CH01_VID05_Steps of Malware Analysis 
Steps Malware Analysis :
2 Static & 2 Dynamic
Static : Examining a file without running it 
Dynamic: Running the malware


A) Basic Static Analysis :
  1 - Confirm whether a file is malicious or not 
  2 - Provide info.about its functionality
  3 - provide info .to produce Simplenetwork signture

  Positives : Straightforeard and quick 
  negative : A ) its not effective with all malware
             B ) Its dosent reveal the full extent of the malware capabilitiea
  


B ) Basic dynamic analysis :
    1 - Runnung the malware in safe and isolated lab enviroment 
    2 - Observing its behavior on the system
    3 - Remove the infection
    4 - Produce effective signatures
C ) Advanced static analysis 
    Loadind the program(executable) into a disassembler and looking at the program instructions which executeed by the CPU


D ) Advanced Dynamic analysis
    using a debugger to examine the internak state of the malware while runuing its execution path state .
