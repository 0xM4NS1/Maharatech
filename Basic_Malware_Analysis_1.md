# CH02_VID08_VM Network options (NAT, bridged, host-only)
NAT & Bridged can access to Network
Host-only we cant access the network

NAT : Network Addressed Translation : its like any process in my host machine .
Bridged : Vm conect direct to the router
Host_only: than not connected in the internet that have a different subnet

Should we allow the malware to access the internet : 
So let's explain what the malware can do when it is executed.
first malware want to connect with domain so
1 - Resolve the domain name to an ip address
2 - Connect to the server using its IP address 
    A - so if we just need to extract IOCs we turn of the network if we create a fake DNS when malware send to my fake DNS server  and send response No response
    B - if the malware type have multi stage  like went to  connect to the attacker server  to let the malware Download secound stage or grab an encryption / decryption key
  Precautions : 
  1 - Use a fake DNS server inside our subnet(host-only network)
  2 - Firewall like pfSense
  3 - Allow certain Protocols only (HTTP or ICMP)
  4 - Always use a proxy or VPN tohide your location
